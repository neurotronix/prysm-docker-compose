## Services
* geth (beacon conntects to it to see deposits for validators)
* beacon
* validator
* slasher
* prometheus
* grafana

**All services are enabled by default.**

### Minimal Setup (beacon & validator only)
In case you want to run only beacon & validator (geth, slasher, prometheus, grafana get disabled) move the `compose-examples/docker-compose.beacon-validator.override.yaml` file in the same folder as your `docker-compose.yaml` and rename it to `docker-compose.override.yaml`. Read up on [docker-compose files & override](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files) to customize your setup further.

## (optional) Configure your node

### Prysm version
Edit `.env` file to set the docker tag to use (version of nodes):
```
PRYSM_DOCKER_TAG=[prysm-version]
```
It's set to the latest stable version.

Version | PRYSM_DOCKER_TAG
--------|------------------
schlesi | schlesi
alpha.8 | HEAD-f831a7

This table gets updated every time a new release happens until prysm dev team adds a "stable" tag or something similar. https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/documentation/issues/103

### Public ip & other Prysm parameters/arguments
Configuration files are located in the folder `./config`. To gain a better connectivity for your beacon node you should specifiy your public ip and/or your dns name in `./config/beacon.yaml`. Follow the guide [Improve Peer-to-Peer Connectivity](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/p2p-host-ip/).

## Validator accounts
Please read up on how to use the [validator](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/how-prysm-works/prysm-validator-client/) to stake funds and how to [activate the validator](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/install/lin/activating-a-validator/). These are only short steps to make it work fast:

1. Put your desired password into `./validator/keystore.json`.
2. Run `docker-compose -f create-account.yaml run validator-create-account` and use the **same password**.
3. Use the `Raw Transaction Data` of the output at https://prylabs.net/participate to send GÃ¶ETH to the smart contract.
4. Run at least the `beacon` and the `validator` (see chapter below) and wait until the deposit is complete and your node is active.

You can repeat step 2 & 3 as often as you like, make sure to restart your validator to make it notice your new accounts!

## Run your prysm Ethereum 2.0 staking node

### Start it up
Run with (as deamon with "-d")
```
docker-compose up -d
```
or run only certain services (in this case only beacon and validator)
```
docker-compose up -d beacon validator
```

### Stop it
Stop services (or everything) like this
```
docker-compose stop validator slasher
```

### Shut it down for good
Shut down your services (or everything) like this:
```
docker-compose down
```
Please note: This will also erase your logs, they are stored with your containers and will be deleted as well.

## Monitoring
### Logging
Docker takes care of log files and log file rotation as well as limit (set to 10x100mb log files for each service).
View logs of a certain service (in this case beacon, only the last 100 lines)
```
docker-compose logs --tail=100 beacon
```

### Prometheus
Runs on http://localhost:9090, scrapes data of beacon, validator and slasher.

### Grafana
Grafana listens on http://localhost:3000 and uses the data provided by prometheus service.

Login with username `admin` and password `admin` (Grafana defaults), data source to Prometheus is already established and dashboards installed.
